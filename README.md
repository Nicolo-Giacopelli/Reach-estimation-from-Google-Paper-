# Reach-estimation-with-Mediametrie
The repo includes the results of a $4$-month research internship offered by Médiamétrie and the Research Center of ENSAE Paris (École Polytechnique). The topic of research was to evaluate the applicability of a model for cross-media audience estimation presented by Google (initially in Koehler, Jim, et al. "Measuring cross-device online audiences", $2016$). The object of the estimate was the number of unique users reached across different platforms, combining television data with cookies from online audiences. </br> </br>
My role has been understanding the statistical model and the solutions other researchers were implementing (like Gibbs Sampling), in order to parallel this with an evaluation of the performance of Machine and Deep learning models. The comparison gave very interesting results, with future applicabilities for the company. Other potential solutions have been proposed, such as Synthetic Nearest Neighbors. </br> </br> 
The notebooks comprise the set of functions define for the algorithms, together with the evaluation of both Google's model and traditional Machine Learning models on simulated data. The final report and slides made for the internship defense (in LateX) include (only) the results on real preprocessed data as well
